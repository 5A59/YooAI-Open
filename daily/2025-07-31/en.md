## Next-Gen AI Applications Surge: User Growth Ranking Reveals Industry Competition Landscape

In 2025, the dynamic of the AI mobile application ecosystem remains strong. The user growth ranking of E-level apps, released on July 31, shows that "Deepsea Cabinet Bureau" (referred to by some media as DeepSeq) has taken the lead in growth, thanks to its powerful interactive experience and multimodal capabilities. Over the past year, the barriers to using AI apps have continued to drop, with innovative AI tools gradually dominating user acquisition and retention. Products driven by deep scenarios are leading the industry's transformation, laying the groundwork for ecosystem reshuffling in the second half of the year.

## AI Visual Technology Leap: Google Imagine4 Shocking Upgrade

AI image generation technology has reached another watershed moment. Google's XiaoRan team has officially launched Imagine4, which far surpasses similar models like GPT-4V in terms of overall image generation power, detail presentation, and style transfer effects. Imagine4 has established a highly controllable, multi-domain adaptable video and image generation engine, making parameter fine-tuning and generating stability powerful tools in professional design, visual effects, and interactive advertising sectors. Technical evaluations show that Imagine4's detail restoration rate in extremely complex backgrounds and dynamic lighting scenarios has improved by 48% compared to previous industry generations, while maintaining low latency even under heavy rendering loads.

## Doubao Accelerates Agent Development: Volcano Engine Releases Co-Model

Volcano Engine has quickly released a new generation "Doubao" image editing co-model. This model is built on multimodal interaction and task-level orchestration, significantly accelerating the efficiency of intelligent agent development. Through modular editing components, users can complete complex image restoration, style expansion, and bulk distribution of text-to-image creations on a single interaction interface. Industry insiders believe this will promote AIGC toward more efficient and modular enterprise services, helping industry clients quickly transition from capturing ideas to content production and implementation.

## New AI Learning System: OpenAI and Google Propel Cognitive Assistants

OpenAI has launched a new generation of learning assistants, deeply integrating the semantic understanding and proactive reasoning capabilities of the ChatGPT model. It supports features such as push-style knowledge briefings, quizzes, difficulty tracking, and advanced path planning. APIs are open for developers and educational technology practitioners to promote ecosystem collaboration. Google has also introduced the AI handwriting tool Node2GLM, which greatly enhances the structural interpretation of learning content by visualizing the "node-relationship" concept in mind maps.

These two products signify a shift in AI education scenarios from “passive Q&A” to “active cognitive guidance” and “multimodal cognitive feedback.” In the future, various types of intelligent educational scenarios will rely more on model reasoning capabilities and personalized dynamic decision-making, making AI companionship a recognized mainstream trend.

## Creative Experience Reshaped: AI Workflow Visualization Deepens Implementation

An “AI whiteboard” product integrating text, image, video, and audio multimodal creative processes has gained significant attention after being reported by CCTV recently. Its innovative interaction paradigm greatly improves collaboration efficiency, allowing a team to decompose tasks, distribute tools, and consolidate content in real-time within the same space, achieving "one-stop" AI content production. Actual evaluations indicate that this product can reduce traditional AIGC process cycles to less than half their original duration. It features built-in privacy layers and permission archiving, meeting compliance and collaborative management needs for enterprise applications.

## Ultra-High Definition AI Restoration Technology Goes Mainstream

AI restoration technology continues to break through, with the open-source tool "Happier" now capable of easily enhancing blurry images to genuine 8K (7952x5760 pixels) with a single click. Thanks to its microscopic texture detail restoration and region-specific intelligent supplementation algorithms, Happier can even restore extreme details of hair and skin, earning widespread acclaim from AIGC users and the photography post-production field. Users can obtain styled and diversified high-quality results in batches simply by providing prompt phrases. The decreasing barriers to the tool's openness and usability are gradually allowing AI restoration to permeate personal image restoration, document digitization, and the complete process in film studios.
